      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student eager to learn more about the world of coding! Passionate about VR/AR development with much to learn in the space.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised just outside Seattle in Bellevue, went to University in Washington D.C.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>You can often find me either making music or playing video games in my free time while the sun is away, or out in the water during the summer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream is to work in AR/MR in any capacity. I am extremely passionate about the types of experiences AR/MR allow for and hope to add a few to the pot.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently located back at home in Bellevue!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After graduating with a degree in Organizational Sciences, I quickly found that the careers available to me didnt quite spark passion and when Covid-19 hit I was able to take a step back and re-evaluate what I truly wanted to be doing, ultimately leading me here! </p>
